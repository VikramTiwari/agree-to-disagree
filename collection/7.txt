X Privacy Policy

Effective: September 29, 2023

Before you scroll, read this

It’s really hard to make everyone happy with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.

With that in mind, we’ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it’s used, and when it’s shared. 

So if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:

 

X is a public platform

Learn what’s viewable & searchable

We collect some data
about you

Learn what we collect & how

Affiliate services may have their own policies

Learn about affiliates

We use your data to make X better

Learn how we make your info work

You can control your experience

Learn how to update your settings

If you have questions about how we use data, just ask

Seriously — what happens with my data?
Seriously — what happens with my data?
What data do you collect about me?

You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.

 

1. Information We Collect

The information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.

Expand dropdowns for more information:

1.1 Information you provide us.
1.2 Information we collect when you use X.
1.3 Information we receive from third parties.
How do you use my information?

To make X the service you know and love.

2. How We Use Information

Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:

Expand dropdowns for more information:
 

 
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.
2.2 Foster safety and security.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.
2.4 Communicate with you about our services.
2.5 Research.
My posts are public?!?
My posts are public?!?
How or when do you share my information?

There’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up: posts can end up in the news or a search engine.

3. Sharing Information

You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.

Expand dropdowns for more information:
 

 
3.1 When you post and share.
3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
Does data have an expiration date?
Does data have an expiration date?
How long do you keep data?

Generally, we keep your data as long as your account is up.

4. How Long We Keep Information

We keep different types of information for different periods of time: 

We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your account.

We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.

Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove it from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.

Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.

We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.

How can I control my data?

You can access it, delete it, or change your settings. Basically, you’re the boss.

5. Take Control

Expand dropdowns for more information:
 

5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.
5.2 Deleting your Information.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.
5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.
How does X handle my information wherever I am?

We treat your information fairly, no matter where you live around the world.

6. Your Rights and Ours

We provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.

Expand dropdowns for more information:
 

6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.
6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.
Is X for kids?

Nope, X is not intended for people under 13.

7. X's Audience

Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

You there, X?
You there, X?
Will this policy change?

If it does, we’ll let you know.

8. Changes To This Privacy Policy


The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.

If we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.

Is this policy viewable in other languages?

Yes, but...

9. General


The X Privacy Policy is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English language version of the X Privacy Policy shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the X Privacy Policy.
